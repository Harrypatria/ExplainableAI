### Overview:
Explainable AI (XAI) is an important area of research that aims to provide a better understanding of how machine learning models make decisions. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a popular XAI method that provides a local interpretation of machine learning models. This repository provides an introduction to XAI and SHAP and demonstrates how SHAP can be used to interpret a machine learning model for income prediction.

### Introduction:
Explainable AI (XAI) is becoming increasingly important as machine learning models become more complex and accurate. XAI aims to provide an understanding of how these models make decisions, which can help build trust in the model and its predictions. One popular XAI method is SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which is a model-agnostic, post-hoc method for interpreting machine learning models.

This repository provides an introduction to XAI and SHAP and demonstrates how SHAP can be used to interpret a machine learning model for income prediction. The code is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn and shap libraries.

### XAI Terminology and Classification:
XAI terminology and classification are important concepts to understand before delving into specific XAI methods. XAI can be classified into three categories: model-specific methods, model-agnostic methods, and hybrid methods.

Model-specific methods: These methods are specific to a particular machine learning model and are used to interpret the model's internal workings. Examples of model-specific methods include decision trees and rule-based systems.

Model-agnostic methods: These methods are independent of the machine learning model and can be applied to any model. Model-agnostic methods are post-hoc, which means they interpret the model's output after it has been generated. Examples of model-agnostic methods include LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP.

Hybrid methods: These methods combine both model-specific and model-agnostic methods to provide a more comprehensive interpretation of the model.

### SHAP Overview:
SHAP is a model-agnostic, post-hoc method for interpreting machine learning models. It is based on cooperative game theory and uses the Shapley Additive Value to allocate the unequal contributions of all the input features in a model. It is an additive feature attribution method, which means it compares the differences with and without each feature to determine its contribution to the model's output. This allows us to quantify the impact of each feature on the model's predictions.

SHAP values provide a local interpretation of a machine learning model by attributing the model output to each input feature. SHAP values can also be used to obtain a global understanding of the model by averaging the SHAP values for all instances in the dataset.

### Income Prediction Example:
To demonstrate the effectiveness of SHAP, we provide an income prediction example. Suppose we have a dataset of individuals with their annual incomes and some demographic and employment-related features. We want to build a machine learning model that predicts the income of an individual given their features.

After training the model, we can use SHAP to interpret its predictions. For example, we can use SHAP to determine the contribution of each feature to the predicted income of an individual. This can help us identify which features are most important for predicting income and which features have a negligible impact.
