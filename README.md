## 🌟 Overview

Explainable AI (XAI) is a vital subfield of artificial intelligence that aims to make the inner workings of machine learning models understandable. This repository offers a beginner-friendly yet insightful introduction to **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**, one of the most powerful tools in the XAI toolbox.

We demonstrate how SHAP can be applied to interpret model predictions on an **income prediction** problem using Python, `scikit-learn`, and `shap`.

## 📘 Summary

### 🔹 Introduction

As machine learning becomes more pervasive, understanding its predictions is critical. XAI allows data scientists to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability. SHAP is especially useful for quantifying the contribution of each feature to individual predictions.

### 🔹 Terminology & Classification

- **Model-Specific Methods**: Tailored to specific algorithms (e.g., decision trees).
- **Model-Agnostic Methods**: Work with any model post-training (e.g., SHAP, LIME).
- **Hybrid Methods**: Combine strengths of both approaches.

### 🔹 SHAP Overview

SHAP applies game theory (Shapley values) to explain predictions. It ensures consistency and local accuracy, making it a gold standard in interpretability. You’ll learn:
- Feature importance
- SHAP summary plots
- Force plots for individual predictions

## 📊 Real-world Example: Income Prediction

Given features like age, education, and occupation, we train a model to predict individual income. SHAP is then used to:
- Visualise global and local feature contributions
- Explore individual predictions
- Understand model behaviour

## 📦 Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- `scikit-learn`
- `shap`
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`
